# What you will make

As part of this class, you'll gain a basic understanding of how graphics, design and data teams across the journalism industry build pages that require customized computer programming.

The tutorial will demonstrate how to:

- Use a command-line interface to issue commands
- Develop HTML, CSS and Javascript within a [static-site framework](https://github.com/datadesk/baker-example-page-template)
- Version and share your code with git and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- Publish a microsite on the Internet with [GitHubâ€™s Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

By the end of this lesson, you will publish a standalone page with a series of graphics examining the high homicide rate in Harvard Park, a small neighborhood in South Los Angeles.

You will create the page by repurposing data from [a 2017 Los Angeles Times story](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-harvard-park-homicides/) by Nicole Santa Cruz and Cindy Chang.

A working example of what you will make can be found at [ireapps.github.io/first-graphics-app](https://ireapps.github.io/first-graphics-app/)
