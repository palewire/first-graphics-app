# What you will make

By the end of this lesson, you will publish a standalone page with a series of graphics examining the high homicide rate in Harvard Park, a small neighborhood in South Los Angeles.

You will create the page by repurposing data from [a 2017 Los Angeles Times story](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-harvard-park-homicides/) by Nicole Santa Cruz and Cindy Chang.

A working example of what you will make can be found at [ireapps.github.io/first-graphics-app](https://ireapps.github.io/first-graphics-app/)
