# Framework

Now that we have our Git repository created, we're going to start installing the tools we need to do our job.

## What is a framework?

The first and more important is our [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework).

What's that? Nothing more than fancy name for a set of software tools that, working together, can stand up a website. Believe it or not, it takes dozens of different software tricks to pull a good site together.

Frameworks aim to make the challenge easier by organizing a curated set of tools into a simplified system that saves time.

There are a lot of different frameworks out there. Maybe you've heard of some them, like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for Python, [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) for Ruby or [React](https://reactjs.org/) for Node.js.

While some frameworks are more popular than others, each newsroom tends to go its own way with a custom system for publishing pages. The programming languages and the details vary, but the fundamentals are almost all the same. Some of them have even been released as open-source software. They include:

- Reuters’ [bluprint](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-kit)
- The Texas Tribune’s [data-visuals-create](https://github.com/texastribune/data-visuals-create)
- The Seattle Times' [newsapp-template](https://github.com/seattletimes/newsapp-template/)
- The NPR Apps team's [dailygraphics](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics)
- Politico's [generator-politico-graphics](https://github.com/The-Politico/generator-politico-graphics)

The GitHub template we cloned in the last chapter is a demonstration of the Los Angeles Times’s tool, which is known as [baker](https://github.com/datadesk/baker) and published as free and open software that anyone can easily reuse at [github.com/datadesk/baker-example-page-template](https://github.com/datadesk/baker-example-page-template).

The remainder of this tutorial will demonstrate how to use The Times’ tool to publish a page to the web. While many of the particulars are specific to the choices made but Times developers, the overall principles are shared by the frameworks employed at other newsrooms.

## Install our system

The Times’ baker framework — like most of its peers — is developed using the Node.js JavaScript programming language.

Now that you have the fundamentals cloned to your computer, installing the underlying dependencies necessary to develop a page requires that you use Node.js’s package manager `npm`.

From your terminal positioned inside of the repository’s directory on your computer, run the following to get everything necessary to start work:

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the test server

Once the dependencies have been installed, you’re ready to preview the project. Run the following to start the test server:

```bash
npm start
```

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. There you can see the generic website offered as a starting point by our framework.

Congratulations, you've got your framework up and running. Now we're ready to start developing our own content.
