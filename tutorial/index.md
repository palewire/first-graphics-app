# First Visual Story

A step-by-step guide to publishing a standalone story from a dataset.

## What you will learn

This tutorial will show you how journalists at America’s top news organizations escape rigid content-management systems to publish custom interactive graphics on deadline.

You will get hands-on experience in every stage of the development process, writing JavaScript, HTML and CSS within a Node.js framework. You won't stop until you've deployed a working application on the World Wide Web.

## Who can take it

This course is free. If you have a good attitude and know how to take a few code crashes in stride, you are qualified. If you’re a little scared, that’s a good thing. You’re ready for this.
