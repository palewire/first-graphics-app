# What next?

If you enjoyed what you learned today, here are some resources to help you get further down the path of news nerdery. Many of these resources are tools we've used ourselves.

- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/) has a pretty good introductory tutorial for basic [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- If charts interest you, there is much more you can do with [Datawrapper](https://academy.datawrapper.de/)!
- Or you could dive into learning [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), [_Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd Edition_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781491921296/) is a good resource if you like learning from a book
- [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/) are also a great way to explore and browse data visualizations, and figure out how they update by changing parts of the code. You can log in with the same GitHub account you used in class today, and Ben's also [written a tutorial](https://observablehq.com/collection/@palewire/first-observable-notebook-2020)
- For mapping, experiment more with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), or for even more flexible maps, check out [Mapbox.js](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/) or the open-source [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/)
